# Video Background Animations

This repo holds the animations that I've used in my videos alongside my monologue

## List
- [Yellow lava lamp pebbles](src/animation.py)
- [Concentric cirles](src/anim2.py)

## Conclusion
These are highly simplistic animations, and a 10 year old with programming knowledge could create these, I created them as I neither wanted to manually animate them nor did I want to steal some stock animation from the internet.
